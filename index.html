        <h2>About the man himself</h2>
        <p>Waluigi is Luigi's lanky rival and Wario's partner. His name is a portmanteau of the Japanese words warui, meaning "bad", and RuÄ«ji, meaning "Luigi". As you may have noticed, his nose is red. This can be attributed to his ADHD medication prescribed by his doctor, Dr. Mario</p>
